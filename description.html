            <h1>What is VanHacks?</h1>
            <p>
                VanHacks is an introductory project that focuses on bringing fellow travelers who share a sense of adventure together. 
            In its' current form, it is merely a prototype developed by a group of beginner programmers. In one hopeful future, we strive to
            create a virtual platform that enables people to meet and connect, host adventure events, and plan trips and follow the footsteps
            of their favorite adventurers. Within this platform, you would be able to write a diary of your experiences, share with others
            your journey and guide them to their own. The world is vast, beautiful, and can equally be dangerous - thus, travelers from both sides
            will have their identities shielded and under an alias until they mutually agree to follow each other. In addition to this, the 
            platform will also have built in health guide systems that gives travelers notices about the particular areas they are interested in and
            connect them to health specialists if needed.
